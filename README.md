This is a custom install script that I made for my convenience.
In this script, I install and remove packages according to my preference.

If you're going to use it, first, make the script executable.
NOTE: ONLY USE THIS SCRIPT ON AN ALREADY INSTALLED DEBIAN INSTALLATION.
THE GNOME DE IS PREFERRED FOR THIS SINCE THATS THE ONLY ONE I'VE TESTED IT WITH.

MAKE THE SCRIPT EXECUTABLE BY RUNNING THE FOLLOWING COMMAND:
chmod +x ./install.sh
